# Pixel Art Image Prompt

## For Blog Header: "horizOn February 2025 Massive Update"

### Prompt

```
16-bit pixel art, wide format 16:9 blog header image. A retro-styled game developer command center viewed from a slightly elevated angle. Dark navy-blue background with a large central widescreen monitor displaying a stylized dashboard with colorful charts and graphs. Around the desk: a small pixel art globe with glowing connection lines circling it (representing global load balancing), a tiny server rack with blinking green LEDs, a mobile phone showing a mini dashboard, and a pixel art robot assistant (representing AI/MCP). On the monitor screen, a subtle crash report notification with an exclamation mark icon. Game engine logos subtly referenced as small icons on sticky notes pinned to a board behind the monitor (a gear, a diamond shape, a pentagon shape). Glowing neon accent colors: electric blue, soft purple, and bright green against the dark background. Clean pixel art style reminiscent of SNES-era RPG menu screens. No text in the image.
